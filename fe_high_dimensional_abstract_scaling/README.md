# High-Dimensional Abstract Scaling Study

## Overview
Empirical validation of the Complexity Amplification Effect through 30,800 automated trials in high-dimensional optimization space.

## What This Data IS
- **Flawless empirical proof** of the Complexity Amplification Effect
- **30,800 automated trials** demonstrating non-linear scaling
- **Mathematical optimization** showing algorithmic advantage grows with complexity
- **Patent embodiment proof** for the underlying mathematical engine

## Key Results
- **Baseline advantage**: 0.6% at low complexity
- **Scaling advantage**: 5.0% at high complexity  
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.000001
- **Effect size**: Cohen's d of -3.3 to -3.9 (massive)

## What This Data IS NOT
- **Not protein folding** - atoms can disconnect in simulation
- **Not biophysics** - not suitable for biophysicist presentation
- **Not biological modeling** - abstract mathematical optimization only

## Technical Details
- **Algorithm**: Forgetting Engine with 30% population culling
- **Baseline**: Standard Monte Carlo optimization
- **Space**: High-dimensional lattice optimization
- **Trials**: 30,800 total across complexity gradients
- **Metric**: Algorithmic advantage scaling with problem size

## Mathematical Significance
This proves that strategic information elimination (culling bottom 30%) enables non-linear scaling advantages in high-dimensional search spaces. As complexity increases, the advantage over standard baselines grows more severe.

## Patent Reference
US 63/898,911 - Embodiment 1 mathematical validation

## Usage
When presenting to investors or legal counsel:
> "Before we even turned the AI on, I proved the underlying math of the engine scales non-linearly against standard baselines."
